Whether you're a data scientist, developer, or just super curious about AI, Prompty has got your back. With this tool, you can say goodbye to dull inputs and hello to creativity and safety. 🎉

## What's Prompty All About? 🤔

Prompty uses some seriously cool AI to understand what you're trying to say and turns that into a prompt that language models dig.
